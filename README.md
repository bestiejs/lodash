## What to Use lodash for and When to Use It  

Lodash's thoroughly-tested methods cover gaps that exist in the JavaScript language itself and can be used for:

* manipulating and iterating over arrays, strings, objects and collections;
* testing and manipulating values;
* creating composite functions that perform many common and less common programming tasks using syntax that is easily understandable;
* and [much more](https://lodash.com/docs).

An important feature of lodash is that it is **customizable with regard to build**. You can mix and match individual functions to create a build to suit your exact needs.  
Loadash allows computations such as **producing unique arrays, intersections of collections, and many others**, to be performed with minimal effort.  
Lodash can be used when **high-performance** is a consideration - it is made to be performant using sensible performance-achieving principles. The criteria for overall optimal performance is not simply speed-based, but balanced with other considerations in mind - result correctness, use context, common case use, and **extreme cross-browser consistency**. Yet due to successful efforts to optimize component methods, including case-use-control of code execution, the speed performance of lodash often exceeds functionally-similar native JavaScript utility options - if they exist.
